# Servo Motor Controlled With BLYNK Over WiFi
## DEMO



Hello All, I hope you are having a great time!

Today, we are gonna build a simple project to control a servo motor with BLYNK app over Wifi.

Overview: The slider on the blynk app will send a value to the NodeMCU/ESP8266 and this value will be written on PIN 8 and the servo rotates that much degrees.

## Step 1: Things We Need
### HARDWARE

- Servo SG90
- NodeMCU
- MicroUSB cable
- Jumper Wires
### Software:
- Arduino IDE
- BLYNK app

## Step 2: Circuit and Connections

## Connections:

- D2 pin of NodeMCU connects to Command pin of Servo Motor.
- 3V3 PIN of NodeMCU connects to Power PIN of Servo motor (usually RED one).
- GND PIN of NodeMCU connects to GND of servo motor (usually BLACK one).

## Step 3: â€‹BLYNK App Setup on Phone
